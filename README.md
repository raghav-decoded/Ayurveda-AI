# Introduction
Ayurveda has a large database of single herbs, minerals, and formulations that have been tailormade to suit each individual, his/her psychosomatic constitution, clinical condition, comorbidities, age, region, etc. These data are spread over more than 150 texts, amidst manuscripts in multiple languages and scripts. With the rise of transcriptional and translational facilities, several traditional medicinal texts are now available in their digitized forms. But for an Ayurvedic student or practitioner, exploring this multitude of literature for identifying their 'drug of choice' often becomes tedious and impractical. Here is the need of a custom software that can identify the apt formulation that has been designed to treat a constellation of symptoms and present it to the student/practitioner along with its reference and other desired properties. 

### Formulation for Symptoms
For example, the two formulations Punarnavadi Kashaya and Vyaghryadi Kashaya are mentioned in texts as follows: Both these are decoctions advised in Jvara (fever) and Kasa (cough). But in a patient with upper respiratory tract infections like common cold (Pinasa), Vyaghryadi would suit better than Punarnavadi. Whereas in a condition associated with inflammatory changes all over the body. I Punarnavadi would be the appropriate choice. The objective of the proposed software is to identify the single drugs and formulations that suit a set of symptoms. 

### Suitable-Unsuitable Ingredients
Certain Formulations are unsuitable for the patient.
